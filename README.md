#Shopping Web Scraping
üõçÔ∏è Shopping web scraping is a cutting-edge process that focuses on grocery stores. This involves using programming techniques to scrape shopping websites and collect data on products such as images, titles, prices, and descriptions. This data is then saved in a JSON file on the local system and uploaded to a database, such as MongoDB, which allows for easy access and analysis. By comparing the prices of the same product from different stores, the Genrocy application can identify the lowest price, helping users to save money and make smarter purchasing decisions. üí∞

This project aims to assist people and families with low income in finding the best prices for their grocery items. By leveraging the power of technology, users can view the product and prices and compare them with ease, helping them make informed decisions and save money. üí∏

To scrape the Genrocy website and retrieve product data, the process works on any website that uses the Shopify service. For example, "https://www.internationalfoods.co.nz/" is a website that deals with American grocery items and uses the Shopify platform. By using the link "https://www.internationalfoods.co.nz/products.json", the product data for this website can be retrieved. This data includes information such as the product name, brand, category, price, and description, among others. üìä

Directly accessing the product data link on the website is not feasible as it is not readable. Therefore, the data needs to be scraped and stored in a local JSON file that is formatted in a way that makes it more readable, such as ["link here"]. This process involves using web scraping tools, such as Python or Beautiful Soup, to extract the relevant data and save it in a structured format. Once the data is saved, it can be easily analyzed and compared to other data sets. üìà

Once the local JSON file is uploaded to MongoDB, front-end development can use MongoDB to access the data and display it on their website, making it more readable and user-friendly. This allows users to view the product and prices and compare them to find the best deals for their grocery items. Additionally, it can help users track price trends over time, allowing them to make more informed decisions about when to buy certain products. This feature can be particularly helpful for families with low income who need to carefully manage their expenses. üôå

In conclusion, shopping web scraping is a powerful tool for helping users find the best prices for their grocery items. By leveraging the power of technology, users can save money and make informed decisions about their purchases. This project, in particular, aims to assist low-income families in managing their expenses and making the most of their limited budgets. By providing access to accurate and up-to-date product data, this project can make a significant difference in the lives of many people. üí™
